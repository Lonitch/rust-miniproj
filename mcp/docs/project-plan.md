## 1. Decision: Build Upon Existing vs. New Implementation

### Build Upon Existing
- **Pros**  
  - Already has robust **JSON-RPC 2.0 handling (requests, responses, notifications)**.  
  - Provides typed request/notification handler patterns.  
  - Well-organized modules: `client`, `server`, `protocol`, `transport`, `types`.  
  - Good coverage of standard initialization, pending requests, and concurrency with `tokio`.  

- **Cons**  
  - Currently lacks an MCP “host” concept, advanced capability negotiation, resource or tool management logic.  
  - Hard-coded single protocol version check (`LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION`).  
  - Some expansions (e.g., subscription logic, advanced concurrency, error management) may require refactoring.  

Given that the existing codebase already implements core JSON-RPC features and has a workable structure, it likely **makes sense to build upon** it. By extending or forking it, I can add the missing MCP features (host concept, multi-version fallback, resource/tool/prompt managers) more quickly than rewriting from scratch.

## 2. Key Features to Support

1. **Transport Layers**  
   - **Stdio**: For local, subprocess-based servers (matching the MCP doc’s stdio approach).  
   - **HTTP / SSE**: For networked services; supports streaming server-to-client messages.  
   - **Optional**: WebSocket or other custom protocols if needed.  
   - Ensure I maintain the same JSON-RPC format in each transport.

2. **Message Handling & Typed RPC**  
   - Keep or enhance the typed request/response approach (like `request_handler<Req, Resp>`).  
   - Provide a simpler API to register new MCP-specific handlers (e.g., “tools/list”, “resources/subscribe”).  
   - Possibly incorporate a plugin-like system or manager for each new MCP concept (tools, resources, prompts).

3. **Error Management**  
   - Support structured errors with meaningful codes (not just `anyhow::anyhow!`).  
   - Consider introducing a typed error enum for server–client interactions (matching the MCP doc’s codes plus JSON-RPC standard).  
   - Provide better logging or user-facing messages in my desktop UI.

4. **Versioning & Capability Negotiation**  
   - Implement a fallback or multi-version approach rather than a single match check.  
   - Merge / intersect client & server capabilities during initialization.  
   - Provide a clear error message or fallback if there’s no version overlap.

5. **Security & Host Concept** (Longer-Term)  
   - Potentially add a “host” layer if I need multi-client orchestration, user consent management, or advanced security.  
   - If my desktop chat app interacts with multiple servers or must enforce permission checks, a host manager would be useful.

6. **Integration with Iced & Claude/OpenAI**  
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for sending queries and receiving streaming responses.  
   - Possibly integrate the typed requests with a “conversation” or “session” structure that coordinates chat messages.  
   - Ensure concurrency doesn’t block the UI thread.

## 3. Roadmap & Checkpoints

### Phase 1: Foundation & Fork
1. **Fork or Import Existing Code**  
   - Create a new Git repository that references the current codebase as a starting point.  
   - Confirm that I can compile, run tests, and do a basic “hello world” request.

2. **Refactor for Clarity**  
   - Improve code comments, rename modules if necessary, ensure the directory structure suits my new crate.  
   - Add top-level documentation describing my MCP-oriented goals.

**Checkpoint**:  
- Basic project structure is ready and consistent.  
- You can spin up a client and server, run the `initialize` method, and confirm round-trip JSON-RPC.

---

### Phase 2: Transport Enhancements & Error Handling
1. **Implement Stdio Transport**  
   - Provide a standard `StdioTransport` that launches a subprocess or communicates via STDIN/STDOUT.  
   - Ensure it lines up with JSON-RPC framing (newline-delimited, or length-prefixed if needed).  
2. **Implement HTTP/SSE Transport**  
   - Optionally incorporate SSE for server push messages.  
   - Provide an example server that can run over HTTP.
3. **Improve Error Handling**  
   - Introduce a typed `McpError` enum or similar, possibly wrapping or replacing some `anyhow::Error` usage.  
   - Provide distinct error codes for request timeouts, connection closed, invalid params, etc.

**Checkpoint**:  
- Two or more robust transport options are tested.  
- Error handling is clearer, with typed errors for critical failure modes.

---

### Phase 3: MCP-Specific Features & Capability Negotiation
1. **Add Real Capability Intersection**  
   - Modify the client’s `initialize` flow to *intersect* `ClientCapabilities` and `ServerCapabilities`.  
   - Return an “agreed” capability set or handle partial rejections gracefully.  
2. **Support Multi-Version Negotiation**  
   - Replace the single version check (`LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION`) with a negotiation step.  
   - Possibly store a small array of supported versions on client & server, pick the best match.  
3. **Resource, Tool, Prompt Management**  
   - Integrate the data structures in `types.rs` with real managers on the server side.  
   - Example: A `ToolManager` that the server can register tools with, and a request handler for “tools/list” and “tools/call.”  
   - Provide client-side wrappers to call these endpoints easily.

**Checkpoint**:  
- The server can dynamically manage resources/tools/prompts in an MCP-like fashion.  
- The client can discover these capabilities and call them, verifying partial fallback if not all are supported.

---

### Phase 4: Host Concept & Security (Optional Advanced)
1. **Multi-Client Host**  
   - If my desktop chat app spawns multiple clients or orchestrates multiple servers, introduce a “host” struct that tracks them.  
   - Implement a basic security policy or user consent flow if my app requires it.  
2. **Subscription Logic**  
   - Let the server notify subscribers of resource updates or changes (like the doc’s subscription approach).  
   - The client can handle server-sent notifications to update the UI in real-time.

**Checkpoint**:  
- You have an optional “host” or orchestrator that unifies multi-client logic.  
- Users can subscribe to resource changes, and the UI receives real-time updates.

---

### Phase 5: Iced Integration & Final Polishing
1. **Integrate with Iced**  
   - Embed the client logic in an Iced application.  
   - Create an asynchronous loop or wrapper that listens for server events and updates the UI.  
2. **Hook in Claude/OpenAI**  
   - Connect the sampling logic or “send message” flows to an LLM endpoint.  
   - Possibly expose these LLM endpoints as “servers” following my new protocol expansions.  
3. **Performance & Load Testing**  
   - Check concurrency under real usage (multiple requests, fast streaming).  
   - Optimize or refine concurrency if needed (tokio-based concurrency is typically good, but confirm no bottlenecks).

**Checkpoint**:  
- The desktop chat app is fully functional with my new MCP-based SDK.  
- You have a stable version that addresses multi-transport support, partial capability negotiation, typed errors, and (optionally) advanced host-level features.
